      <div><h1>Electronic Instruments</h1>
    
        <section class="definition"><p>An electronic musical instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound 
        using electronic circuitry. Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical, electronic or digital audio 
        signal that ultimately is plugged into a power amplifier which drives a loudspeaker, creating the sound heard 
        by the performer and listener.</p>

        <p>An electronic instrument might include a user interface for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the
         pitch, frequency, or duration of each note. A common user interface is the musical keyboard, which functions 
         similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic piano, except that with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard itself 
         does not make any sound. An electronic keyboard sends a signal to a synth module, computer or other electronic 
         or digital sound generator, which then creates a sound. However, it is increasingly common to separate user 
         interface and sound-generating functions into a music controller (input device) and a music synthesizer, 
         respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as 
         MIDI or Open Sound Control. </p>
